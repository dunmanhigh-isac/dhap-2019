The Project Planning subcommittee helms the various ceremonies throughout your DHAP 2019 journey - spanning from the Opening Ceremony to Dinner and the Closing Ceremony. They promise to make delegatesâ€™ DHAP experience one worth remembering beyond council sessions with the various ceremonies! 

They look forward to meeting delegates at DHAP 2019 and hope that delegates will have a fulfilling and fun time.
