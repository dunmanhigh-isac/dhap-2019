### Head Chair

To attract a wild Jonathan, all you need to do is to leave either a set of chemistry notes or a basketball in an open area, however you may have to wait a while as he is usually "lepak-ing" in a corner somewhere. Other than these hobbies, Jonathan also has a strong passion for current affairs and global issues, which kind of explains why he's in ISAC. Though he won't really be spending much time with delegates, he hopes that delegates will have an enriching experience at DHAP.
