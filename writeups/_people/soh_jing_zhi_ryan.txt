### Backroom Member

Otherwise known as the guy whose eyes cannot be seen when he smiles, Ryan enjoys eating and sleeping and awaits the day he will be free of all work so that he can catch up on his sleep. During his free time, he is often found scrolling through his news resource that resembles nothing but a Twitter, due to his interest in global affairs, or Youtube where he finds mashups to listen to! He also looks forward to seeing the council have a fruitful experience together and wishes all delegates the best!
