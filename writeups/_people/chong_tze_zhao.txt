### Frontroom Chair

Tze (pronounced “Zi”) Zhao is a JC1 student taking the rarely spotted subject combination of Physics, Computing, Math and History. Despite being having the stereotypical nerdy traits of a science student, his strong interest in the humanities has led him to join the MUN circuit. He spends whatever free time he has juggling between reading wikipedia pages, studying memes, and digesting any other random information he can get his itchy hands on. He hopes that council will find this MUN fruitful and wishes the council all the best.
