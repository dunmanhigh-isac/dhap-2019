### Deputy Secretary-General (Organising Committee)

Eileen tries her best in everything she does - (though sadly) especially in things with no discernible reward or value, such as trying to learn everyoneâ€™s names spelled backwards. Despite classified a tad bit eccentric and wild by some, Eileen preserves and continues being friendly to everyone she knows (refer to above point about always giving her best). She hopes that all delegates will have an enjoyable and fruitful time at DHAP 2019!
