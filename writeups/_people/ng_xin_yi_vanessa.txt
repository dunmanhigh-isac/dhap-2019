### Assistant Executive Director

Vanessa is a little monkey girl who likes to run and screech and jump and scream all day, everyday. Despite recently having suffered a ligament tear - due to playing again, of course - she has continued to live her reckless lifestyle. She cannot and will not be stopped. To spot her at DHAP 2019, look out for someone who can be heard way before she can be seen! To add on, she aspires to live in a farm with 10 dogs and a few cows - animals which will bring her maximum utility. Support Vanessa by joining DHAP and in stopping dog meat trade. She hopes that all delegates will have an enjoyable DHAP, particularly the socials she planned for them.
