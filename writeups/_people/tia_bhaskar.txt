### Executive Director

The physical embodiment of an overly tactile cat stuck in a human body, she seeks hugs constantly but also gives them freely to people who need a little comfort. A dedicated person who gives her all regardless of the situation, she always strives to never let anyone down and her consistent efforts are evident in her disciplined active lifestyle as well. She could use with more sleep, what with the pathetic number of hours that she is clocking in, partly because of school & partly because she’s a diehard Borussia Dortmund fan, HEJA BVB! A caring friend who’s “mum-mode” override is more of a reflex than anything, she always looks out for those around her.
