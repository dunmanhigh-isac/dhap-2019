### Secretary-General

Amanda is a Year 6 student studying at Dunman High School taking the combination of History, Economics, Linguistics and Math. Having chaired the Historical Crisis Committee at DHAP 2018, Amanda is honoured to be serving as the Secretary-General for the conference this year. Beyond MUN, Amanda enjoys tofu stew, fried squid and watching videos of baby sloths climbing. She also likes interacting with stray cats, who hopefully reciprocate her feelings. She hopes that delegates will not only emerge from the conference with academic fruitions, but also meaningful friendships with fellow delegates.
