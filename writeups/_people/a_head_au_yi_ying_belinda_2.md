### Head Chair

Belinda is a Y6 Arts student from an empowering all-girl class, and contrary to speculation that she does such a subject combination of History, Economics, E.Literature and Math due her being inept at Sciences (though she doesnâ€™t deny that fact), she actually loves studying them. Known to be witty, sassy and fiery despite her smaller size that makes her susceptible to being lost in a crowd often, Belinda also enjoys learning about new issues, engaging in literature and the Arts, watching adorable dog videos, as well as funny and political memes amidst her hectic schedule. Lastly, as part of the Special Programs Committee, Belinda also looks forward to facilitating the delivery of a more fulfilling and memorable DHAP experience for the delegates this year!
