### Head Chair

Despite sharing the same surname as a certain great leader, Maisy is far from interested in nuclearisation or North Korea or diplomacy in general and would much rather spend her time observing rock formations and pissing her friends off with random nuggets of geographical knowledge. Maisy can usually be found sleeping on random benches around the school and can easily be summoned at the mere mention of cats or food discounts. Alternatively, Maisy can be spotted shuttling in between school blocks with a look of absolute frenzy on her face, fretting over and inflating small issues into major  catastrophes. Given the elusive nature of her committee, Maisy will probably be difficult to find but bonus points if you manage to find her and leave an impression (hopefully positive).
