### Crisis Director

Having ended a fulfilling run of sixteen conferences as a delegate and chair, Adam is excited to take on his first crisis backroom role. With crisis experience as a delegate in both local and overseas conferences, Adam will step up to be part of the team that runs the most advanced council in MUN. Whether you are trying crisis for the first time or a seasoned crisis delegate, he hopes that you will have a meaningful and enjoyable learning experience here at DHAP HCC - just as he has.
