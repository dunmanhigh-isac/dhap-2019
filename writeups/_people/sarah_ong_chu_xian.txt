### Chair

Sarah, the self-proclaimed mother of more than a 100  people in total, is a functional extrovert with a love for all things MUN. When she isn't struggling to prepare for MUN conferences with homework piling up in the background, she does research on current affairs in a futile effort to bulk up her general knowledge. She hopes that all delegates will relish in the spirit of learning just as much as she will in the 3 days of intellectually-stimulating debate in UNSC.
