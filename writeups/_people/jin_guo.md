Jin Guo is a year 5 DHS student who is always keen to learn more about different perspectives of an issue through comprehensive discussion. Although she can sense that the year ahead is going to be a challenging one, Jin Guo will try her best to overcome the challenges with positive mindset. She hopes that delegates will have a fruitful and meaningful debate this DHAP!
