### Executive Director

Cherylynn is a Year 6 student at Dunman High School. Despite being in Project Planning,  Cherylynn (ironically) has problems with planning her time and projects. At the time of writing, Cherylynn has a few tests to study for, a dozen of emails to send out and tons of overdue work to clear. As such, Cherylynn cannot afford to spend too much time on this biography. In short, Cherylynn hopes that everyone will PRESS on and she looks forward to seeing everyone in a desirable state at DHAP 2019!
