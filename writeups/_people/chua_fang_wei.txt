### Deputy Secretary-General (Executive Board)

Fangwei has actively participated in past editions of DHAP in various capacities, including those of a delegate and a chair. This has allowed her to develop a keen interest in regional affairs. She hopes that DHAP will serve as a unique platform for delegates to discuss the past, present and future of Southeast Asia, acquire invaluable life skills, and become better versions of themselves in the process.
