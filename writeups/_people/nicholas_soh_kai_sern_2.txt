### Crisis Director

Nicholas is a Year 6 student who, like every other student in his cohort, is suffering from the shackles of the A levels. Nicknamed "Winnie the Pooh" by his Economics tutor, he as admitted that he shares many uncanny similarities with it (including looks). Like how Pooh made his last appearance in the Christopher Robin movie, DHAP 2019 would be Nicholas' swan song. In school, he is usually seen struggling to stay awake during lectures as well as attempting to cope with his infinite number of commitments! He is aware that MUN is more often than not a very nerve-wracking experience, but believes that there is still much to gain from it. He looks forward to seeing delegates have a fruitful and enjoyable time during council. He assures all that HCC will be one that will go down in history as a crisis simulation like no other. :')
