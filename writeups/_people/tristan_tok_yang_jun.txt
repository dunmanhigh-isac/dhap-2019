### Head Chair

What's poppin'? Tristan is a Year 6 student from Dunman High School, taking the subjects Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics and Economics. Apart from being part of the International and Strategic Affairs Council, he is a proud goalkeeper of Dunman High School Soccer and he enjoys keeping up with football/soccer in his spare time. Also, he is a huge basketball fan and he watches and plays ball in his free time, with his favourite player of all-time being Allen Iverson. Music is another passion of his and he finds great satisfaction in grabbing the microphone once in awhile in a karaoke booth. He hopes that delegates will have stimulating and productive debate during council sessions and that they will have an amazing DHAP experience!
