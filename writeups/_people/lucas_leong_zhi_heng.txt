### Chair

Lucas takes 3 core science subjects, plays 2 instruments, and takes Music as a H3 subject. He wonders how he ended up here, but will nonetheless continue to do his best for DHAP 2019. He hopes that his efforts will come to fruition and that delegates will throughly enjoy their experience at DHAP!
