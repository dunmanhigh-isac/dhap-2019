### Chair

Ashley is currently a year five student who constantly overthinks every aspect of her life. Her favourite subject is literature because it's very human and lets her understand just a little bit more about the people around her. Also, she probably needs help for her milk tea addiction (but tries to ignore that fact regularly) and hopes that the delegates will enjoy the debate sessions at DHAP 2019!
