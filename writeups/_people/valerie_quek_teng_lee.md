### Chair

Exploring new horizons, taking up new challenges and speaking up for oneâ€™s belief, Valerie is a Dunmanian who constantly changes the way she think. She is a JC 1 student currently still in her honeymoon period of senior high life, thinking that she has all the time in the world. Unfortunately, she's not been in touch with reality. The 1am bed time, 5 seconds nap during lessons and the ever deepening and darkening eye bags tell a story otherwise. With her subject combination being pcmg, she's excited to take part in this conference and she wishes all delegate a fruitful and enjoyable debate.
