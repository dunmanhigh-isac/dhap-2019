### Chair

Yuting is a Year 5 student who with an inexplicable interest in philosophy, literature, mythology and many more things less talked about in her circle of friends. A big shy nerd at heart, she does not really talk a lot unless engaged in topics of her interests, in which she proceeds to ramble non-stop and flood one with chunks of information from who-knows-where. Too bad she was afraid to pursue her interests in humanities and is currently regretting her science stream subject combination. Yuting is (in a good way) cursed to spend most of her leisure time either dancing or analysing BTSâ€™s music. She hopes to see delegates come to DHAP 2019 with a positive attitude which looks forward to fruitful debates and a precious learning experience!
